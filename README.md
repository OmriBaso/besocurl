credits for pieces of code taken from other places are inside the code  
some code was taken from the Px project  
https://github.com/genotrance/px/blob/master/px.py  
Download pycurl from: https://dl.bintray.com/pycurl/pycurl/
# Dependencies:   
      pycurl-7.43.0.2  (I added the installation for Windows that matchs python 3.6 because thats the one i used to build this library)  
      python 3.x 
      Installtion:  
      Windows:
            1. Install pycurl.exe from here to your python version https://dl.bintray.com/pycurl/pycurl/
      Linux:
            1. apt install libcurl4-openssl-dev libssl-dev  
            2. apt install python-dev python3-dev build-essential libssl-dev libffi-dev libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev zlib1g-dev  
            3. python3 -m pip install setuptools wheel pycurl  

# Technical Information  
the besoCurl project comes to make Pycurl more human usable while implmenting 
more automatic approch to the library, the library supports SSPI authentication to proxies over HTTP or HTTP(s) 
besoCurl has simple functions such as:  
```python  
import besoCurl
def main():  
    url = 'http://192.168.189.136/'
    useragents = 'Mozilla/5.0 AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko; compatible; Googlebot/2.1; Safari/537.36'  
    headers = ["Accept: OmriBeso", "Content-type: application/json"]  
    r = besoCurl.get(url, headers=headers, user_agent=useragents, auto_detect_proxy=True)  
    print(r.text)  
main()  
```
OR for a post request
```python
import besoCurl
def main():
    url = 'http://192.168.189.136/'
    useragents = 'Mozilla/5.0 AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko; compatible; Googlebot/2.1; Safari/537.36'
    headers = ["Accept: OmriBeso", "Content-type: application/json"]
    r = besoCurl.post(url, data=data, headers=headers, user_agent=user_agent, auto_detect_proxy=True)
    print(r.text)
main()    
```
the code infront of you will return the HTML content of the url inserted into the function,  
user the User-Agent set to it and the headers. 
also - `auto_detect_proxy=True` will try to fetch the windows settings for accessing the internet. 
if a PAC file is configured it will download it and parse the Javascript in order for you go through   
the proxy, if a PAC file is configured AND a manual proxy is set, it will choose the PAC path instead.  
if only a manual proxy is set it will use it, if no proxy is configured i will not use any proxies and go directly to the internet.  
if a proxy is set, the HTTP request will use SSPI to authenticate to the proxy without entering any credentials.  
More Information about how it works: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/rpc/security-support-provider-interface-sspi-  
In general i recommend to use `auto_detect_proxy=True` all the time.  
you can also set a proxy manully when invoking a request as the variables `proxies=[("127.0.0.1", 8080)]`  
proxies must have the format mentioned above.  
TODO:  
1. add WPAD (Auto Detect Settings support) - DONE 06/01/2021,  
2. add PUT method,  - DONE 06/01/2021
3. and multipart forms on POST requests 
4. add session options so request will not authenticate everyime they are sent all over again
